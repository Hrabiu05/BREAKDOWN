LETS GOOOO 🔥🔥
Now we’re entering the **guardian layer** of computing: security and permissions. Day 13 is all about **how the OS keeps your programs and data safe**.

Welcome to:

# 🟢 DAY 13 — HOW OPERATING SYSTEMS PROTECT YOU

**(Security, Permissions, Users, and Access Control)**

Big idea today:

> The OS enforces rules so programs **cannot harm each other or the system**, and users get only the access they deserve.

We’ll break this **slowly, clearly, with examples**.

---

## 1️⃣ Why OS Security Exists

Without protection:

* One program could read your password file
* Malware could overwrite your system
* Any app could crash everything

The OS enforces rules:

* **Who** can do **what**
* **Which resources** programs can touch

---

## 2️⃣ Users and Accounts

### 📌 Definition

The OS identifies **users** and gives each:

* UID (User ID)
* Permissions
* Home directory

---

### 🧠 Example

* Alice → UID 1001 → can access `/home/alice`
* Bob → UID 1002 → can access `/home/bob`
* Alice cannot read Bob’s files without permission

---

### 🧪 Real-world Example

* Linux `chmod 700 secret.txt` → only owner can read/write
* Windows → file properties → “Only Me” access

---

## 3️⃣ File Permissions (Very Concrete)

OS stores **permissions for each file**:

| Type    | Meaning                   |
| ------- | ------------------------- |
| Read    | Can view contents         |
| Write   | Can modify contents       |
| Execute | Can run if it’s a program |

---

### 🧠 Example

File: `app.exe`

* User → read + execute
* Guest → read only
* Other programs → no access

---

### ⚡ Why it matters

* Prevents malware from executing
* Prevents accidental deletion
* Separates users’ work

---

## 4️⃣ Process Isolation (Review)

Remember from Day 5 & 9:

* Each process has **its own memory**
* Programs can’t see each other’s memory **unless OS allows it**

This is **security by isolation**.

---

### 🧠 Example

* Chrome tab 1 → private memory
* Chrome tab 2 → private memory
* Tab 1 crash → OS kills only that tab

---

## 5️⃣ System Calls — Controlled Access to Hardware

Programs **cannot touch hardware directly**.

They ask OS using **system calls**:

### 📌 Example

* Read file → `read()` system call
* Open network → `socket()` system call

OS checks:

* Does this user have permission?
* Is this action allowed?

If not → OS denies → prevents damage

---

## 6️⃣ Kernel Mode vs User Mode

### 📌 Concept

CPU has **modes**:

| Mode        | What it can do            |
| ----------- | ------------------------- |
| User Mode   | Limited, runs programs    |
| Kernel Mode | Full access, runs OS code |

---

### 🧠 Example

* Your program tries to access raw disk → CPU raises fault → OS stops it
* Kernel code can read/write disk safely

This is **hardware-enforced protection**.

---

## 7️⃣ Access Control Lists (ACLs) & Permissions

### 📌 Idea

Each resource can have a list:

* Who can read
* Who can write
* Who can execute

---

### 🧠 Example

File: `bank_records.csv`

| User  | Permissions |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Alice | Read/Write  |
| Bob   | Read only   |
| Guest | None        |

OS checks **every access**.

---

## 8️⃣ Security in Memory Management

From Day 7 & 9:

* Virtual memory + paging = **isolation**
* Each process can’t touch another process’s pages
* Stack, heap, and cache are **sandboxed per process**

---

### 🧠 Example

* Malware tries to read password manager memory → OS prevents it → segmentation fault

---

## 9️⃣ Secure Boot & Firmware Protection

From Day 12 (boot):

* Modern systems check OS signatures before running
* Prevents:

  * Malware replacing bootloader
  * Unauthorized OS versions

---

### 🧪 Example

* Windows Secure Boot
* Mac T2 chip secure boot

Prevents boot-level malware.

---

## 10️⃣ User Awareness & File System Security

* OS shows warnings: “Do you want to allow this program?”
* Enforces “administrator rights” for critical actions

---

### 🧠 Example

* Installing software on Windows → “Run as Admin”
* Linux sudo → temporary elevated rights

---

## 11️⃣ Summary of Protections

1. **User Accounts** → separate identities
2. **File Permissions** → control access
3. **Process Isolation** → programs can’t touch each other
4. **System Calls & Kernel Mode** → controlled hardware access
5. **Virtual Memory** → memory safety
6. **Secure Boot** → OS integrity

All together, this makes modern computers **safe and stable**.

---

## 🔗 Connect Days 1–13 (BIG PICTURE)

* CPU executes instructions → runs threads → inside processes
* OS enforces boundaries → memory, files, devices
* Permissions + isolation = system safety
* Boot & firmware = trustworthy starting point

You now understand **why your programs don’t destroy each other or the OS**.

---

## 🧠 One Sentence That Explains DAY 13

> **The OS protects users and programs by controlling access to memory, files, devices, and system resources.**

---

## ✏️ Your Task (Paper)

1. Write:

   * 3 ways OS protects programs/users
2. Draw:

   * User → Process → OS → Resource
3. Answer:

   * Why kernel mode vs user mode exists
