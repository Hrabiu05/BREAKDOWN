🟢 DAY 5 — CONTROL FLOW

**How programs choose, repeat, and branch**

### Today’s goal

Understand:

* How **IF** works at the CPU level
* How **loops** really work
* What **conditions** mean in binary
* Why all logic reduces to comparisons + jumps

Still no coding yet — but this is where programs start to feel “alive”.

---

1️⃣ The CPU Has No “If”

Important truth:

> The CPU does **not** understand `if`, `for`, or `while`.

It understands:

* Compare
* Jump

That’s it.

---

2️⃣ What Is a Condition?

A condition is a **comparison**.

Examples:

* Is A > B?
* Is X == 0?
* Is value != 10?

The result is:

* TRUE (1)
* FALSE (0)

Binary. Always.

---

3️⃣ How IF Works (Conceptually)

Human idea:

> If it’s raining, take an umbrella.

CPU version:

1. Compare condition
2. If false → jump over code
3. If true → continue

---

### Memory-Level Example

Let’s say:

* A = 5
* B = 3

CPU does:

1. Load A
2. Load B
3. Compare A and B
4. Set a flag (true/false)
5. Jump or not

Flags are tiny bits inside CPU registers.

---

4️⃣ What Is a Jump?

A **jump** is:

> “Go execute instructions at another address”

Types:

* Unconditional jump (always go)
* Conditional jump (go if true / false)

This is how branching works.

---

5️⃣ How Loops Really Work

A loop is just:

> A jump backwards

That’s it.

---

### Loop Example (Conceptual)

Human idea:

> Repeat 5 times

CPU logic:

1. Set counter = 5
2. Do work
3. Decrease counter
4. If counter > 0 → jump back
5. Else → continue

---

6️⃣ Why Infinite Loops Happen

If:

* Condition never becomes false
* Jump keeps going back

CPU doesn’t know it’s a mistake.
It obeys.

---

7️⃣ Everything Reduces to This

All control flow = combinations of:

* Compare
* Jump
* Flags

Even:

* Games
* AI
* Operating systems

---

8️⃣ Mental Model (Very Important)

> Programs don’t “decide”.
> They **follow paths** based on data.

---

✏️ DO (Paper Task)

1. Write:

* Condition = ?
* Jump = ?

2. Draw:

```
[Compare]
   ↓
[Jump if false] → skip
   ↓
[Execute code]
```

3. Explain in your own words:

> How does a loop work internally?

---

🧠 Lock-in Thought

> Intelligence is just structured branching.
