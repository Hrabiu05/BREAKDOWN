🟢 DAY 1 — HOW A COMPUTER THINKS (DETAILED)

---
1️⃣ What is a CPU? (Deep but simple)
📌 Definition
**CPU (Central Processing Unit)** is the part of the computer that:
* Reads instructions
* Decides what they mean
* Executes them
* Repeats this billions of times per second

A CPU does **only 4 basic things**:
* Move data
* Do math
* Compare values
* Jump to another instruction

That’s it. Everything else (games, AI, browsers) is built from these.

---
🧠 CPU Example (Human analogy)
Imagine a worker who:
* Can only read **one sentence at a time**
* Has a **tiny notebook** (registers)
* Follows instructions **literally**
* Never asks *why*

Example instruction:
> “Add the number in box A to the number in box B”

The CPU:
1. Takes numbers into registers
2. Uses ALU to add
3. Stores the result back

---
🔩 Parts of the CPU (with examples)
1. Registers
* Smallest & fastest memory
* Inside the CPU
* Holds values currently being used

Example:
* Register A = 5
* Register B = 3
* ALU adds → result = 8

---
2. ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
Does:
* Math: `+ - × ÷`
* Logic: `AND OR NOT`
* Comparisons: `> < ==`

Example:
> Compare: Is 10 > 7?
> CPU returns: **TRUE**

This is how `if` statements work later.

---
3. Control Unit
The boss of the CPU:
* Tells ALU what to do
* Tells registers what to load
* Decides which instruction comes next

Example:
> “Instruction 102 says ADD, so send values to ALU”

---
2️⃣ What is RAM? (Detailed)
### 📌 Definition
**RAM (Random Access Memory)** is:
* Temporary memory
* Where programs **live while running**
* Where data is stored **while being used**

When power is off → RAM is **empty**.

---
🧠 RAM Example (Desk analogy)
Think of RAM as a **desk**:
* You put books (programs) on it
* You open pages (instructions)
* You remove books when done

Disk = bookshelf
RAM = desk
CPU = reader

---
📦 What exactly is inside RAM?
RAM contains:
1. Program instructions
2. Variables (numbers, text, etc.)
3. Stack (function calls)
4. Heap (dynamic memory)

Example:
If you open a calculator:
* Program code → RAM
* Number you type (e.g., 42) → RAM
* Result → RAM

---
⚡ Why RAM is needed
CPU is **extremely fast**
Disk is **very slow**

If CPU waited for disk:
* Computer would feel frozen

So:
> CPU only works with **RAM**

---
## 3️⃣ What is a Program? (Concrete)
### 📌 Definition
A program is:
* A **list of instructions**
* Stored on disk
* Loaded into RAM
* Executed by CPU

At the lowest level:
> A program = **numbers**

Example:
10101101
00010110
11001001

Each number = one instruction.

---
🧠 Program Example (Simple task)
Task:
> “Add two numbers and show result”
Steps:
1. Load first number
2. Load second number
3. Add them
4. Store result
5. Display result
6. Stop

That’s a full program.

---
4️⃣ What Happens When I Run a Program? (Step-by-step)
Let’s say you click **Run Calculator**.

---
🖱️ Step 1: You click the program
* Program is on disk (SSD/HDD)
* Nothing is running yet

---
🧠 Step 2: Operating System steps in
The OS:
* Finds the program file
* Reserves space in RAM
* Loads program into RAM

Example:

> Calculator.exe → RAM address 0x400000

---
📥 Step 3: CPU starts executing
CPU:
* Gets the starting address
* Fetches first instruction from RAM

This starts the **Fetch–Decode–Execute cycle**.

---
🔁 Step 4: Fetch–Decode–Execute (CRITICAL)
Example instruction:
> “ADD R1, R2”

CPU does:
1. **Fetch** → Get instruction from RAM
2. **Decode** → Understand it's ADD
3. **Execute** → ALU adds values
4. **Store** → Result goes to register or RAM

Repeat. Millions of times.

---
🛑 Step 5: Program ends
* CPU reaches STOP instruction
* OS cleans RAM
* Memory is freed

Program is done.

---
5️⃣ CPU ↔ RAM Interaction (Very clear example)
Example:
You type **5 + 3** in calculator.
1. 5 stored in RAM
2. 3 stored in RAM
3. CPU loads 5 → register
4. CPU loads 3 → register
5. ALU adds → 8
6. Result saved to RAM
7. Screen shows 8

CPU never remembers anything permanently.

---
🧠 One Sentence That Explains Everything
> **A computer is a fast worker (CPU) repeatedly reading tiny instructions from a workspace (RAM).**

---
✏️ Your Task (Important)
On paper, write:
* CPU parts
* RAM contents
* Program flow in your own words

Don’t aim for perfection. Aim for **understanding**.
