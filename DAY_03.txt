# 🟢 DAY 3 — HOW PROGRAMS ARE STORED & RUN

*(Files → RAM → CPU)*

This day connects **everything** you’ve learned so far.
I’ll explain **each stage**, with **examples**, slowly and clearly.

---

## 1️⃣ What Is a Program File?

### 📌 Definition

A **program file** is:

* A file stored on disk (SSD/HDD)
* Contains **instructions + data**
* **Not running** yet

Examples:

* `calculator.exe`
* `chrome.exe`
* `game.app`

Right now, they are just **bytes on disk**.

---

### 🧠 Important Truth

> A file on disk does **nothing** by itself.
> It must be **loaded into RAM** to run.

---

### 🔍 What’s inside a program file?

A program file contains:

1. Machine instructions (binary)
2. Metadata (how to load it)
3. Static data (constants, images, text)

Example (simplified):

```
[ Header ]
[ Code ]
[ Data ]
```

Still just **0s and 1s**.

---

## 2️⃣ Disk vs RAM (Why Two Places Exist)

### 🧱 Disk (SSD/HDD)

* Permanent
* Large
* Slow

### ⚡ RAM

* Temporary
* Smaller
* Extremely fast

---

### 🧠 Example

Opening a game:

* Disk → stores the game forever
* RAM → holds the game while playing
* Close game → RAM is cleared

---

## 3️⃣ The Operating System’s Role (VERY IMPORTANT)

The **OS** is the boss.

When you double-click a program:

1. OS checks permissions
2. OS allocates RAM
3. OS loads file into RAM
4. OS starts the CPU at entry point

Without OS:

> You’d have to do all this manually 😄

---

## 4️⃣ Loading a Program into RAM (Step-by-Step)

Example: You run **Calculator**

### 🖱️ Step 1: Click program

* File exists on disk
* OS is notified

---

### 📥 Step 2: OS loads program

OS:

* Reads program file
* Copies code into RAM
* Sets memory layout

Example RAM layout:

```
Code section
Data section
Stack
Heap
```

---

### 📍 Step 3: Entry Point

The OS tells the CPU:

> “Start executing at address X”

This address is the **first instruction**.

---

## 5️⃣ Memory Layout of a Running Program

Every running program gets its own memory space.

### 🧠 Typical layout:

```
+------------------+
| Code             |
| (instructions)   |
+------------------+
| Data             |
| (constants)      |
+------------------+
| Heap             |
| (dynamic memory) |
+------------------+
| Stack            |
| (functions)      |
+------------------+
```

---

### 📌 Stack (Example)

Used for:

* Function calls
* Local variables
* Return addresses

Example:

* Call function A
* Stack grows
* Function ends
* Stack shrinks

---

### 📌 Heap (Example)

Used for:

* Dynamic data
* Objects created at runtime

Example:

* Open image
* Image data stored in heap
* Close image → freed

---

## 6️⃣ CPU Starts Running the Program

Once loaded:

* CPU begins execution
* One instruction at a time

---

### 🔁 Fetch–Decode–Execute (Again, but in context)

Example instruction:

> “LOAD value from address 5000”

CPU:

1. Fetch instruction
2. Decode operation
3. Load value into register
4. Move to next instruction

Billions of times per second.

---

## 7️⃣ Instructions vs Data (Critical Concept)

CPU sees **bytes**.

How does it know:

* This byte = instruction?
* That byte = data?

Answer:

> **Context**

* Code section → instructions
* Data section → values

Same byte, different meaning.

---

### 🧠 Example

Byte:

```
01000001
```

As data → `'A'`
As instruction → “Move register”

Meaning depends on **where it is**.

---

## 8️⃣ Multitasking (Why Many Programs Run Together)

The CPU runs **one instruction at a time**.

So how:

* Browser
* Music
* Game
* OS

All run together?

---

### ⏱️ Answer: Time Slicing

OS:

* Runs Program A for 2 ms
* Switches to Program B
* Switches to Program C

So fast it looks simultaneous.

---

### 🧠 Context Switching

OS saves:

* CPU registers
* Program counter
  Then restores another program.

---

## 9️⃣ When a Program Ends

Example: Close Calculator

OS:

1. Stops CPU execution
2. Frees RAM
3. Cleans resources

File remains on disk.

---

## 🔗 Connect Day 1–3 (Big Picture)

1. Program = bytes on disk
2. OS loads bytes → RAM
3. CPU reads bytes
4. Bytes → instructions & data
5. CPU executes → result

---

## 🧠 One Sentence That Explains DAY 3

> **Programs are files until the OS loads them into RAM and the CPU starts executing their instructions.**

---

## ✏️ Your Task (Paper)

1. Draw:

   * Disk
   * RAM
   * CPU
2. Show arrows: Disk → RAM → CPU
3. Label:

   * Code
   * Stack
   * Heap
