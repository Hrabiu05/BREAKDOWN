🟢 DAY 6 — WHAT AN OPERATING SYSTEM REALLY DOES

**The boss of all programs**

### Today’s goal

Understand:

* Why the OS exists
* What problems it solves
* How it controls CPU, memory, and programs
* What *really* happens when multiple programs run

Still no coding. Systems thinking.

---

1️⃣ Why an Operating System Exists

Imagine:

* No OS
* Programs talk directly to hardware

Problems:

* Programs overwrite each other’s memory
* Multiple programs fight for CPU
* Anyone can crash the machine
* No security

So we need a **manager**.

---

2️⃣ What Is an Operating System?

An **Operating System (OS)** is:

> A program that manages **hardware** and **other programs**

Examples:

* Windows
* Linux
* macOS
* Android

The OS:

* Starts first
* Never stops (until shutdown)
* Controls access to hardware

---

3️⃣ Core Responsibilities of an OS

### 🔹 1. Process Management (CPU control)

CPU can run **one thing at a time per core**.

OS creates the illusion of multitasking by:

* Giving each process a tiny time slice
* Switching very fast

This is called **context switching**.

---

🧠 Example

You:

* Listen to music
* Browse web
* Chat

CPU:

* Music (2 ms)
* Browser (2 ms)
* Chat (2 ms)
* Repeat

Feels simultaneous.

---

4️⃣ Memory Management

OS:

* Gives each program its own memory space
* Prevents programs from touching others

This is why:

* One app crashing ≠ system crash

Virtual memory makes programs think:

> “I own the whole memory.”

They don’t.

---

5️⃣ File System Management

OS:

* Organizes disk into files & folders
* Controls read/write access
* Keeps track of locations

Programs never talk to disk directly.
They ask the OS.

---

6️⃣ Hardware Abstraction

Hardware is messy.

OS provides:

* Simple interfaces
* Drivers for hardware

Example:

> Program says: “Print this”
> OS figures out **how**.

---

7️⃣ Security & Permissions

OS decides:

* Who can run what
* Who can access which files
* What needs admin rights

This protects:

* System
* User
* Data

---

8️⃣ User Space vs Kernel Space

### User Space

* Normal programs
* Limited power
* Can’t touch hardware directly

### Kernel Space

* OS core
* Full access
* Dangerous if broken

System calls are the bridge.

---

9️⃣ What Happens When You Run a Program (OS View)

1. You click program
2. OS checks permissions
3. OS allocates memory
4. OS loads program
5. OS schedules CPU time
6. Program runs
7. OS cleans up after exit

OS is always watching.

---

🧠 Mental Model (Critical)

> The OS is a **referee**, not a player.

---

✏️ DO (Paper Task)

1. Write:

* OS = ?

2. List:

* 4 things OS controls

3. Draw:

```
User Programs
     ↓
 Operating System
     ↓
 Hardware
```

🧠 Lock-in Thought

> Without an OS, modern computers are chaos.
