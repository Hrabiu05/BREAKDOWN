🟢 DAY 2 — BITS, BYTES & MEMORY:
*(This is where computers stop feeling “mystical” and start feeling obvious.)*
I’ll break **everything**, with **examples on each part**, slow and clean.

---
1️⃣ What is a BIT?:
📌 Definition;
A **bit** is the **smallest unit of information** in a computer.
A bit can be **only one of two values**:
* `0` → OFF
* `1` → ON

That’s it.
No numbers, no letters, no colors yet.

---
💡 Real-world analogy:
Think of a **light switch**:
* OFF = 0
* ON = 1

Computers are made of **billions of tiny switches**.

---
🧠 Why only 0 and 1?:
Because:
* Electronics are reliable with **two states**
* Voltage LOW = 0
* Voltage HIGH = 1

Simple = fast = stable.

---
✅ Example
If I give you:
1
That’s **one bit**.

If I give you:
0
Still **one bit**.

Alone, a bit is almost useless.
Power comes from **groups of bits**.

---
2️⃣ What is a BYTE?:
📌 Definition;
A **byte = 8 bits**

Example:
01000001

That’s **one byte**.

---
🧠 Why 8 bits?:
History + practicality;
* 8 bits can represent **256 different values**
* Enough to store:
  * letters
  * numbers
  * symbols

---
🔢 How many values can 1 byte store?:
Each bit has 2 choices...

So:
2⁸ = 256 values

Range:
0 → 255

---
✅ Byte example (numbers)
00000000 = 0
00000001 = 1
00000010 = 2
11111111 = 255

---
✅ Byte example (letters):
Using ASCII encoding;
01000001 = 'A'
01000010 = 'B'
01100001 = 'a'

So the letter **A** is literally:
> a pattern of ONs and OFFs

---
3️⃣ How Do Numbers Work in Binary?:
Computers don’t understand **base 10** like humans.
They use **base 2 (binary)**.

---
🔢 Binary counting:
Decimal → Binary
0  = 0000
1  = 0001
2  = 0010
3  = 0011
4  = 0100
5  = 0101
6  = 0110
7  = 0111
8  = 1000

Each position means:
1  2  4  8  16  32 ...

---
✅ Example: Binary 101:
1×4 + 0×2 + 1×1 = 5

So:
101 = 5

---
4️⃣ How Does Text Become Bits?:
Computers use **encoding systems**...

The most basic one:
### ASCII

---
📌 ASCII example:

| Character | Binary   |
| --------- | -------- |
| A         | 01000001 |
| B         | 01000010 |
| a         | 01100001 |
| 0         | 00110000 |
| !         | 00100001 |

So the word:
"Hi"
Is stored as:
H → 01001000
i → 01101001

---
🧠 Important realization:
> Computers do NOT know what letters are.
> They only know numbers.
> **Meaning is assigned by humans.**

---
5️⃣ What is Memory Really?:
📌 Memory = numbered boxes;
RAM is just:
> A huge list of boxes, each holding **1 byte**

Each box has:
* An **address**
* A **value**

Example:
Address   Value
0x1000 → 01000001
0x1001 → 01000010

---
🧠 Memory address example:
If RAM says:
Address 2048 = 01001000

CPU understands:
> “At place 2048, the value is 72 (H)”

---
6️⃣ How Programs Use Memory:
Example: Store number 10

Binary:
10 = 00001010

Stored in RAM:
Address 3000 → 00001010

CPU later:
* Reads address 3000
* Loads value into register
* Uses it

---
7️⃣ Bigger Memory Units (Very important)

| Unit | Size             |
| ---- | ---------------- |
| Bit  | 1 bit            |
| Byte | 8 bits           |
| KB   | 1,024 bytes      |
| MB   | ~1 million bytes |
| GB   | ~1 billion bytes |

---
✅ Example:
A **1 GB RAM** can store;
* ~1 billion characters
* ~250 million integers (4 bytes each)

---
8️⃣ How Everything Connects (Big Picture):
Let’s connect **DAY 1 + DAY 2**;
1. Programs are stored as **bytes**
2. Bytes are stored in **RAM**
3. CPU reads bytes
4. CPU interprets bytes as instructions or data
5. Everything becomes **bits**

---
🧠 One Sentence That Explains DAY 2:
> **All data—numbers, text, images, programs—is just patterns of 0s and 1s stored in memory.**

---
✏️ Your Task (Do this on paper):
1. Write what a **bit** is
2. Write what a **byte** is
3. Convert:
   * Binary `1010` → decimal
   * Decimal `7` → binary
4. Write how the letter **A** is stored
