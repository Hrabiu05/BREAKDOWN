🟢 DAY 9 — PERFORMANCE

**Why some programs are fast and others are slow**

### Today’s goal

Understand:

* What “performance” actually means
* Where time is really spent
* The real bottlenecks in programs
* Why hardware doesn’t magically save bad logic

Still no code. Just sharp thinking.

---

1️⃣ What Is Performance?

Performance = **how efficiently resources are used**

Resources:

* CPU time
* Memory
* Disk I/O
* Network I/O

Fast ≠ just CPU speed.

---

2️⃣ The Big Lie

> “My computer is slow.”

Reality:

> The program is inefficient.

Hardware only amplifies or hides problems.

---

3️⃣ Where Programs Actually Spend Time

Most time is spent:

* Waiting (I/O)
* Accessing memory
* Repeating unnecessary work

CPU math is often the **smallest** cost.

---

4️⃣ CPU Is Not the Main Bottleneck (Usually)

CPUs are extremely fast.

Slower things:

* RAM access
* Disk access
* Network

Orders of magnitude slower.

---

5️⃣ Memory Access Matters (A Lot)

Accessing:

* Registers → instant
* Cache → very fast
* RAM → slower
* Disk → painfully slow

Good programs:

* Use memory efficiently
* Avoid unnecessary data movement

---

6️⃣ Algorithms Matter More Than Hardware

Example:

* Bad algorithm on fast CPU → slow
* Good algorithm on slow CPU → fast

Repeating work kills performance.

---

7️⃣ I/O Is the Silent Killer

Reading files, waiting for user, network calls:

* CPU often sits idle
* Program waits

This is why async and batching exist.

---

8️⃣ Multitasking ≠ Parallelism

* Multitasking = switching
* Parallelism = true simultaneous work

More threads ≠ faster by default.

---

9️⃣ Mental Model (Very Important)

> Performance is about **doing less work**, not working faster.

---

✏️ DO (Paper Task)

1. Write:

* Performance = ?

2. Rank from fastest to slowest:

   * CPU register
   * RAM
   * Disk
   * Network
3. Answer:

> Why can a fast CPU still feel slow?

---

🧠 Lock-in Thought

> Efficiency beats power.
