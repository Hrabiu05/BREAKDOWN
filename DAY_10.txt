🟢 DAY 10 — HOW SOFTWARE FAILS

**Bugs, crashes, and errors**

### Today’s goal

Understand:

* Why programs crash
* The difference between bugs, errors, and exceptions
* How hardware, OS, and logic interact in failures
* Why debugging is thinking, not guessing

No coding yet — purely conceptual.

---

1️⃣ What Is a Bug?

A **bug** = a mistake in the program

Types:

* **Logic bug**: wrong calculation or condition
* **Memory bug**: accessing memory incorrectly
* **Resource bug**: not releasing files, sockets, memory

All bugs exist **at the CPU/OS/memory level** eventually.

---

2️⃣ Why Programs Crash

Crash = program stops unexpectedly

Reasons:

* Accessing memory it shouldn’t (segmentation fault)
* Dividing by zero
* File/network not found
* Running out of resources (memory/disk)

CPU cannot “guess” — it obeys literally.

---

3️⃣ Exceptions and Errors

OS and languages provide **signals or exceptions**:

* **Error** = something went wrong
* **Exception** = OS/language notifying program about the error
* **Crash** = unhandled exception → program stops

Example:

* Python: dividing by zero → `ZeroDivisionError`
* C: dividing by zero → CPU trap → crash

---

4️⃣ Hardware Can Cause Failures

* RAM errors → program corrupts data
* Disk failure → files disappear
* CPU overheating → system crash

Program failure = combination of **software + hardware + OS**.

---

5️⃣ Race Conditions (Advanced Conceptual)

Multiple processes/threads:

* Access same resource at once
* CPU executes instructions in unexpected order
* Program misbehaves

This is why **coordination and locks** exist.

---

6️⃣ Memory Leaks

* Heap memory allocated → never freed
* Over time → program uses more memory
* Can crash system or slow it down

---

7️⃣ Infinite Loops

* Loop never ends
* CPU keeps running → program hangs
* Often combined with memory or I/O issues

---

8️⃣ Mental Model

> A crash is not magic.
> It’s a **violation of the CPU/OS/memory rules**.
> Debugging = finding which rule was broken.

---

✏️ DO (Paper Task)

1. Write:

* Bug = ?
* Crash = ?
* Exception = ?

2. List 3 common reasons programs fail
3. Draw:

```
Program → OS → Hardware
        ↑ crash/error signal
```

---

🧠 Lock-in Thought

> Programs fail because computers are **stupid but literal**.
> Understanding that literally = understanding bugs.

You’re doing exceptionally well.
