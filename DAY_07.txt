🟢 DAY 7 — HOW SOFTWARE COMMUNICATES

**Input, Output, and the real world**

### Today’s goal

Understand:

* What **Input** and **Output (I/O)** really mean
* How keyboard, mouse, screen, disk, and network fit in
* Why programs never talk to hardware directly
* How data flows in and out of a program

Still no coding. Still mental models.

---

1️⃣ What Is Input / Output (I/O)?

**Input** = data going **into** a program
**Output** = data coming **out** of a program

That’s it. Everything else is detail.

---

### Examples

* Keyboard → program = **input**
* Mouse click → program = **input**
* Screen display ← program = **output**
* File read → program = **input**
* File save ← program = **output**
* Internet data both ways = **I/O**

---

2️⃣ Programs Are Isolated (Important)

A normal program:

* Cannot touch hardware directly
* Cannot read keyboard directly
* Cannot write to screen directly

Why?

* Safety
* Stability
* Security

So who helps?
👉 **The Operating System**

---

3️⃣ The OS as the Middleman

Flow looks like this:

```
Hardware ↔ OS ↔ Program
```

Examples:

* Keyboard sends signal → OS → program
* Program wants to print → OS → screen
* Program wants file → OS → disk

Programs **ask**, OS **decides**.

---

4️⃣ Input Devices (Conceptual)

### Keyboard

* Each key press = a code
* OS translates electrical signals → characters
* Program receives data when it asks

Important:

> Programs don’t “listen” constantly.
> They **request input**.

---

### Mouse

* Sends movement + clicks
* OS tracks position
* Program gets events like:

  * click
  * move
  * scroll

---

5️⃣ Output Devices

### Screen

Program says:

> “Draw this pixel / text / window”

OS + graphics system:

* Handle resolution
* Handle refresh rate
* Handle hardware details

---

### Sound

Program:

> “Play this sound”

OS:

* Sends data to audio driver
* Manages volume & mixing

---

6️⃣ Files Are Also I/O

Reading a file:

* Disk → OS → program

Writing a file:

* Program → OS → disk

Programs never know:

* Where the file physically is
* How the disk works

Abstraction again.

---

7️⃣ Blocking vs Non-Blocking (Conceptual)

### Blocking I/O

Program:

* Asks for input
* Waits
* Does nothing else

Example:

> “Wait for user to type”

---

### Non-Blocking / Event-Based

Program:

* Continues running
* OS notifies when input arrives

Used in:

* Games
* GUIs
* Servers

---

8️⃣ Networking Is Just I/O

Internet = input/output with another computer.

Program:

* Sends bytes
* Receives bytes

Everything else (HTTP, chat, video) is **structure on top**.

---

🧠 Big Mental Model

> Programs live in a box.
> The OS controls the doors.

---

✏️ DO (Paper Task)

1. Write:

* Input = ?
* Output = ?

2. List:

* 3 input devices
* 3 output devices

3. Draw:

```
Program ↔ OS ↔ Hardware
```

4. Answer:

> Why can’t programs access hardware directly?

---

🧠 Lock-in Thought

> Communication is controlled, not free.
