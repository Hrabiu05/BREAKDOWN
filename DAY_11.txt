🟢 DAY 11 — DATA STRUCTURES

**How programs organize data**

### Today’s goal

Understand:

* What a data structure is
* Why structure matters for speed, memory, and logic
* Conceptual examples of arrays, lists, stacks, queues, and dictionaries/maps
* How memory and CPU interact with structured data

No coding yet — pure mental modeling.

1️⃣ What Is a Data Structure?

A **data structure** = a way to **organize and store data** so programs can use it efficiently.

Analogy:

* Shelf (array)
* Stack of plates (stack)
* Mailbox system (queue)
* Dictionary (lookup table)

---

2️⃣ Arrays (Sequential Storage)

* Continuous memory locations
* Fast to access by index
* Fixed size (mostly)

Example:

```
Numbers: [10, 20, 30, 40]
```

* Index 0 → 10
* Index 1 → 20

CPU can jump directly → very fast.

---

3️⃣ Linked Lists (Sequential but Flexible)

* Each element points to the next
* Easy to insert/delete
* Slower to access by index

Analogy:

* Treasure hunt: “Go to first → follow pointer → next → next…”

---

4️⃣ Stack (LIFO)

* Last In, First Out
* Think: plates in a cafeteria
* Used for:

  * Function calls
  * Undo operations

---

5️⃣ Queue (FIFO)

* First In, First Out
* Think: line at a checkout
* Used for:

  * Task scheduling
  * Print jobs
  * Network packets

---

6️⃣ Dictionaries / Maps

* Key → Value pairing
* Very fast lookup
* Analogy:

  * Phonebook: “Name → Number”
  * Computer stores memory addresses as keys

---

7️⃣ Why Structure Matters

* CPU reads memory
* Cache works better with predictable layout
* Algorithm speed depends on how data is organized

Example:

* Searching unsorted list → slow
* Searching dictionary → fast

---

8️⃣ Mental Model

> Organizing data properly = telling the CPU **where and how to look** efficiently.

---

✏️ DO (Paper Task)

1. Write:

* Data structure = ?

2. List examples:

* Array
* Stack
* Queue
* Map

3. Draw a stack and queue with 3 items each
4. Explain:

> Why is a dictionary lookup faster than scanning an array?
