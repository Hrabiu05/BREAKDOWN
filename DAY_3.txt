🟢 DAY 3 — PROGRAMS, LANGUAGES & COMPILERS

**How human ideas become CPU instructions**

### Today’s goal

Understand:

* What a **programming language** is
* Why CPUs don’t understand Python/Java/C++
* What a **compiler** and **interpreter** do
* How code turns into machine instructions

Still no coding yet — just mental clarity.

1️⃣ Why We Need Programming Languages

### Reality check

The CPU understands only:

```
10101010
00011100
```

Humans don’t.

So we invented **languages** that are:

* Easier to read
* Easier to write
* Less error-prone

Example (human idea):

> “Add two numbers”

---

2️⃣ High-Level vs Low-Level Languages

#🧠 Low-Level Languages

Close to the CPU.

Examples:

* Machine code
* Assembly

Pros:

* Very fast
* Full control

Cons:

* Hard to write
* Easy to mess up

---

🧠 High-Level Languages

Close to human thinking.

Examples:

* Python
* Java
* C++
* JavaScript

Pros:

* Easy to read
* Faster to write

Cons:

* Need translation

---

3️⃣ The Big Truth

> **The CPU does NOT understand programming languages.**

It only understands **machine code**.

So something must translate.

---

4️⃣ What is a Compiler?

A **compiler**:

* Takes your code
* Translates it into machine code
* Saves it as a program file

Example flow:

```
C++ code → Compiler → Machine code → Program
```

When you run it:

* OS loads machine code into RAM
* CPU executes directly

Fast.

---

5️⃣ What is an Interpreter?

An **interpreter**:

* Reads your code
* Translates it **line by line**
* Executes immediately

Example flow:

```
Python code → Interpreter → CPU
```

Slower, but flexible.

---

6️⃣ Hybrid Languages (Real World)

Many modern languages do both.

Example:

* Java → compiled to bytecode → interpreted by JVM
* Python → compiled to bytecode → interpreted

You don’t need details yet — just the idea.

---

7️⃣ Example: One Idea, Three Levels

### Human idea:

> “Add 5 and 3”

### High-level language:

```
result = 5 + 3
```

### Assembly (simplified):

```
LOAD 5
LOAD 3
ADD
STORE result
```

### Machine code:

```
10101100
00010111
```

Same idea. Different forms.

---

8️⃣ Where Does the Compiler Live?

* Compiler = a program
* Stored on disk
* Runs on CPU
* Uses RAM

Yes — compilers are just programs too 🤯

---

✏️ DO (Paper Task)

1. Write:

   * CPU understands: ______
   * Humans write: ______
2. Draw flow:

```
Human idea
   ↓
Programming language
   ↓
Compiler / Interpreter
   ↓
Machine code
   ↓
CPU
```

3. Write:

> “A programming language is a tool for humans, not CPUs.”

---

🧠 Lock-in Thought

> Code is not magic.
> It’s just **translated instructions**.
