🟢 DAY 2 — BITS, BYTES & MEMORY
**How computers store *everything***
### Today’s goal
Understand:
* What a **bit** really is
* How bits become **numbers, text, images**
* What a **byte** and **memory address** are

No code again. Still foundations.

---

1️⃣ What is a Bit?
A **bit** is the smallest unit of information.
It can be:
* `0` → OFF
* `1` → ON

Physically:
* Voltage low / high
* Switch off / on
* Charge absent / present

💡 A computer understands **only this**.

---

2️⃣ Why Only 0 and 1?
Because:
* Electronics are unreliable in the middle
* Two states are **stable and safe**

So computers use **binary**.

Example:
0 = no electricity
1 = electricity

---

3️⃣ From Bits to Numbers
A single bit is boring.
So we **group bits**.

1 bit
0 or 1

2 bits
00 = 0
01 = 1
10 = 2
11 = 3

3 bits
000 = 0
111 = 7

Each extra bit **doubles** what you can represent.

---

4️⃣ What is a Byte?
A **byte = 8 bits**

Example:
01000001
That’s a byte.

With 1 byte you can represent:
* Numbers 0 → 255
* Or letters
* Or symbols

---

5️⃣ How Letters Are Stored (Text Example)
Computers use standards like **ASCII**.
Example:
A = 65 = 01000001
B = 66 = 01000010

So the word:
"Hi"

Is stored as:
H = 72
i = 105

Just numbers in RAM.

---

6️⃣ How Images Are Stored (Simple)
An image is:
* A grid of pixels
* Each pixel = color value
* Each color = number

Example:
* Black = 0
* White = 255

So an image is just:
> **A huge list of numbers in memory**

---

7️⃣ What is Memory (RAM) Really?
RAM is:
* A long row of boxes
* Each box has:

  * An **address**
  * A **byte of data**

Example:
Address 1000 → 01000001
Address 1001 → 01000010

CPU says:
> “Give me what’s at address 1000”

RAM responds instantly.

---

8️⃣ Why Addresses Matter
Without addresses:
* CPU wouldn’t know where data is
* Programs would overwrite each other

So:
> Every byte in RAM has a **unique address**

This is the base of pointers later.

---

✏️ DO (Paper Task)
1. Write:
   * Bit = ?
   * Byte = ?
2. Draw:
Address → Value
1000    → 01000001
1001    → 01000010
3. Write:
> “Everything in a computer is numbers.”

---

🧠 Lock-in Thought

> Text is numbers
> Images are numbers
> Sound is numbers
> Programs are numbers

Only **meaning** changes.
