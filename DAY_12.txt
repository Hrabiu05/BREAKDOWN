🟢 DAY 12 — ALGORITHMS

**How programs solve problems efficiently**

### Today’s goal

Understand:

* What an algorithm really is
* Why efficiency matters
* Conceptual examples: search, sort, and basic logic
* How data structures + algorithms work together

No coding yet — just thinking.

1️⃣ What Is an Algorithm?

An **algorithm** = a **step-by-step recipe** to solve a problem.

Key points:

* Input → Steps → Output
* Must **terminate** (not infinite)
* Must be **correct** and ideally **efficient**

Analogy:

* Recipe for cooking
* Directions for a robot
* Instructions for assembling IKEA furniture

---

2️⃣ Why Efficiency Matters

Efficiency affects:

* CPU cycles
* Memory usage
* User experience

Example:

* Searching a list of 10 items → fast
* Searching a list of 10 million → slow if unoptimized

---

3️⃣ Searching Example

### Linear Search

* Check each element sequentially
* Simple, slow for large data

Analogy:

> Looking for a book by flipping each page

---

### Binary Search (with sorted data)

* Check middle element
* Decide left/right half
* Repeat

Analogy:

> Opening dictionary to the middle, then left or right

Much faster.

4️⃣ Sorting Example

Why sort?

* Makes search faster
* Organizes output

Common strategies (conceptual):

* Bubble sort → simple, slow
* Quick sort → clever divide-and-conquer
* Merge sort → splits, sorts, merges

---

5️⃣ Algorithms + Data Structures

Data structures + algorithms = **power combo**

Example:

* Dictionary (hash table) → fast search
* Array → fast access by index
* Stack → easy undo operations

Wrong structure → slow algorithm

---

6️⃣ Real-World Analogy

Problem: Find your friend in a city

* Algorithm: Walk street by street (linear) or use GPS directions (optimized)
* Data structure: Street map (organized), list of houses (unordered)
* Efficiency = time to find friend

---

7️⃣ Mental Model

> Algorithm = *how you use your tools (data)* to get results
> Data structure = *how you store your tools*

CPU executes instructions → algorithms tell it what instructions to run.

✏️ DO (Paper Task)

1. Write:

* Algorithm = ?
* Why efficiency matters = ?

2. Draw:

* Linear search vs binary search conceptually

3. Explain in your own words:
