🟢 DAY 8 — HOW PROGRAMS COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER

**Processes, messages, and coordination**

### Today’s goal

Understand:

* What a **process** really is
* Why programs are isolated
* How programs safely communicate
* The main communication methods (conceptual)

Still no code. Still architecture.

---

## 1️⃣ What Is a Process?

A **program** is a file on disk.
A **process** is a program **in execution**.

When you run a program:

* OS creates a process
* Gives it:

  * Memory
  * CPU time
  * An ID (PID)

Each process thinks:

> “I’m alone.”

It’s not.

---

## 2️⃣ Why Processes Are Isolated

Isolation prevents:

* Crashes spreading
* Data corruption
* Security issues

If one process breaks:

* OS can kill it
* Others survive

This is one of the OS’s biggest jobs.

---

3️⃣ But Programs Must Communicate

Examples:

* Browser ↔ network service
* App ↔ database
* Music app ↔ audio system

So we need **controlled channels**.

---

4️⃣ Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

IPC = safe ways for processes to talk.

OS provides these.

---

5️⃣ Common IPC Methods (Conceptual)

🔹 1. Pipes

* One process writes
* Another reads
* One-directional

Example:

```
Program A → Pipe → Program B
```

Used heavily in Linux.

---

🔹 2. Shared Memory

* Two processes share a memory region
* Very fast
* Requires coordination

OS sets rules.

---

🔹 3. Messages / Queues

* Processes send messages
* OS delivers them
* Decoupled

Think:

> Mailboxes

---

🔹 4. Signals

* Simple notifications
* “Hey, stop”
* “Hey, reload”

Very lightweight.

---

🔹 5. Sockets (Important)

* Used for networking
* Works locally and over internet

Browser ↔ Server = socket communication.

---

6️⃣ Client–Server Model

Very common pattern.

* Client asks
* Server responds

Examples:

* Browser → website
* App → database
* Game → game server

Even on the same machine.

---

7️⃣ Why the OS Is Always Involved

Processes never:

* Share memory freely
* Talk directly

OS:

* Creates channels
* Enforces rules
* Prevents abuse

---

8️⃣ Mental Model (Critical)

> Processes are strangers.
> The OS is the trusted mediator.

---

✏️ DO (Paper Task)

1. Write:

* Program = ?
* Process = ?

2. Draw:

```
Process A → OS → Process B
```

3. List:

* 3 ways programs can communicate

4. Answer:

> Why is direct memory sharing dangerous?

---

🧠 Lock-in Thought

> Cooperation requires rules.
